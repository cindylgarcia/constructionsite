# Site Building Exercise - Reference Entities

The lesson for the site building exercise in the Drupal Course
online was on referenced entities. 
We created a construction site with
several content types and created a field with a reference entity to one of the
content types. We created nodes of the content type with the referenced entity. 
The nodes were displayed on the hompage as teasers.
